    <div class="gradient">To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the
        colors you want to render smooth transitions among. Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a
        variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent
        variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variableYou
        can also set a starting point and a direction along with the gradient effect.In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the
        relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory
        variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression
