    <p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating
        systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus
        Torvalds.Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

        Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided
        by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software
        Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some
        controversy.

        Popular Linux distributionsinclude Debian, Fedora Linux, and Ubuntu, which in itself has many
        different distributions and modifications, including Lubuntu and Xubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red
        Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as
        X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may
        omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable,
        anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.[21]
